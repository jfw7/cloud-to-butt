# find-love
Chrome extension that finds love and immediately changes your vibration

since it is not an official plugin, you will have to download it, unzip it, and then drag the .crx file to chrome's "extensions" page (chrome://extensions). it will ask for your permission. it shouldn't break anything or steal your data but i do not guarantee anything.

once it's installed you just have to click the heart button next to the address bar and it will find some love in whatever you're reading. it doesn't work on billboards, ads on the train, or non-chrome browsers unfortunately. i hope it works, i have only tried it on my computer.
